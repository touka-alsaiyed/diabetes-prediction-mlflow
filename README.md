# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction with MLflow

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes using the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The workflow includes training, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and performance monitoring using **MLflow**.
